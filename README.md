# Wallcat-Saver
Saves your favorite Wallcat wallpapers to your local computer.

So far, this script only works in **Mac OSX/MacOS** and with versions of **wallcat 1.1.0 and up**. :cat:
 
## How to use (if you don't know how to use the terminal): 
1. Save script to Desktop. 
2. Open the Terminal anyway you'd like. Using the spotlight search is easiest.

    ```command+space then type 'terminal'```
3. Navigate to the desktop
    
    ```cd ~/Desktop```
4. Execute Script.

    ```./wallcat-saver.sh```
5. Script will list wallpapers that are available to be saved. Just type in the number you'd like.
6. Profit! :grin:
